# Phonebook

This is a simple contacts management application built with React, Redux, and NextUI. The application allows users to manage their contacts by adding, deleting, and filtering them. Backend simulation is achieved using [`mockapi.io`](https://mockapi.io/). Styling is implemented using the Next UI component library and the Tailwind CSS framework.

## Features

- Add new contacts: Users can add a new contact by providing their name and phone number.
- Delete contacts: Users can remove existing contacts from the phonebook.
- Filter contacts: Users can filter contacts by name to quickly find the desired contact.
- Theme Switcher: Toggle between light and dark themes for a personalized experience.
